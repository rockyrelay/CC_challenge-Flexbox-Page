## Project Requirements  

### Main Requisites

- [ ] A title and logo or splash image.
- [ ] A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- [ ] A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
- [ ] A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.   


### Flexbox Requisites

>Your project should use flexbox styling for layout. Aim to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.


- [ ] Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
- [ ] Create a flexible display of company products that changes from a more grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
- [ ] Create a flexible display of company employees.  

### Styling Notes

>Your page should also use custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.

Our example site uses:

- [ ] A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
- [ ] Fonts from the Google Fonts API.
- [ ] Custom images. A great source for project images when you’re practicing web design is Unsplash.
